Learning git hub

I started a git hub with my Codeacademy, but didn't use it and I forgot how to work it. So now I'm learning how to use it again. I started working on an app to print OWCP 957 forms, got a good ways through it and realized that having a method to make changes and revert back is very valuable. So I'm starting from here saving my versions.
